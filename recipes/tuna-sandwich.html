<h1>Tuna Sandwiches: Tuna Salad or Tuna Melt</h1>

<p>Canned tuna is one of my favorite protein sources. It's easier than
cooking raw meat or fish, and it can be surprisingly tasty if you treat it
right. Since tinned tuna is unbearably dry on its own, mixing in a tablespoon or so of mayo
adds some fat to the party and results in a more pleasing texture.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Canned tuna</li>
        <li>1-2 Tbsp mayo per can of tuna</li>
        <li>A healthy glob of mustard</li>
        <li>Seasonings: salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, dried herbs, a pinch of cayenne if you're feelin' spicy</li>
        <li>Chopped celery (I usually don't include this because I'm lazy, but it provides a nice crunch)</li>
        <li>A chopped up pickle or lemon juice for some acidity</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Just mix all these ingredients and you're good to go! From here the possibilities are endless. 
        Here are some of my favorite ways to use this tuna salad:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Use as a dip for crackers or toasts</li>
        <li>For a classic tuna salad sandwich, spread the tuna salad on a slice of bread and top with lettuce, tomato,
        and another slice of bread.</li> 
        <li>For a diner-style tuna melt, add a slice of cheese to a tuna salad sandwich, and toast it in a pan until both sides
            are browned and the cheese is melted. </li>
    </ul>
